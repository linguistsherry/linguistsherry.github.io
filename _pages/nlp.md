<h1>MIT Programs in Digital Humanities</h1>

<p><b>Digital Humanities</b> was established with the goal of "advancing the humanities with code, communication, and community". We use state-of-the-art digital tools to enrich education and research in the humanities. Our programs integrate digital and humanities education, teaching, and research.</p>

<p>I serve as a Graduate Assisant in the Spring 2021 Project, <b>"Technology and Language Learning"</b>. My main responsibilities include assistanting NLP tasks in the project, and mentoring a group of around 20 undergraduate students with a Computer Science background. My supervisors were Professor Stephanie Ann Frampton (Faculty Director) and Ryaan Ahmed (Technical Director).</p>
