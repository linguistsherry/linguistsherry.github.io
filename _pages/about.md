My name is Sherry Yong Chen, and I currently work as a Technical Program Manager at Amazon Artificial General Intelligence. In 2022, I completed my PhD in Linguistics from MIT, specializing in language processing and child language acquisition. I have experience in technical product management and data analyses for language products. 

As a language scientist
======
I am interested in exploring areas where linguistics, psychology, and computer science meet, with the goal to improve our understanding of how humans and machines acquire and comprehend language. I code in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am also experienced in statistical modeling and experimental design, and have led multiple, cross-institutional/continental collaborative projects. Beyond MIT, I have earned the Natural Language Processing Specialization Certificate offered by deeplearning.ai. 

My PhD work
======
I work primarily on semantics and pragmatics. My doctoral dissertation, which received a grant from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2140399">National Science Foundation</a>, investigated how adults and preschool-aged children understand presuppositional - information in complex linguistic environments. <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/147224">[MIT Libraries Archive]</a>

I have also worked on several research projects in computational linguistics; see <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/nlp/">[NLP Projects]</a> and <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/research/">[Research]</a> for details. 

Language technologies and products
======
I'm currently pursuing a career in language technologies. In my current role as a TPM, I manage technical programs that improve Alexaâ€™s LLM-empowered answering abilities, diversify the modes of customer experiences on multi-modal devices, and consolidate tech stacks to drive operational efficiency. I love being the "dot connector", and I work closely with engineers, scientists, and product managers, to drive initiatives across AGI teams and deliver features that our customers love. Prior to joining Amazon's Alexa AI team, I interned as an NLP/Linguistics Engineer on the Data Science Team at Principal Financial Group.
