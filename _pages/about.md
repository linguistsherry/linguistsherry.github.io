My name is Sherry Yong Chen, and I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at MIT (expected: June 2022). I specialize in psycholinguistics, with experience in natural language processing, data analytics, and quantitative research. 

As a researcher
======
I am interested in exploring areas where linguistics, psychology, and computer science meet, with the goal to improve our understanding of how humans and machines acquire and comprehend language.

My PhD work
======
I work primarily on semantics, pragmatics, and their interfaces, involving theoretical as well as experimental inquiries. In my dissertation, I investigate the non-uniformity of presupposition projection in complex linguistic environments (if-conditionals and disjunctions), drawing on empirical data from adult language processing and child acquisition.

NLP and Computational Linguistics
======
I have worked on several research projects in computational linguistics, including language model evaluation and ambiguity resolution (see <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/nlp/">[NLP Projects]</a> and <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/research/">[Research]</a> for details). 
I code in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am also experienced in statistical modeling and experimental design, and have led multiple, cross-institutional/continental collaborative projects. In Summer 2021, I worked as an NLP/Linguistics Engineer Intern on the Data Science Team at Principal Financial Group. 

I’m a quick and avid leaner, always prepared to learn new things and develop my skillset. Beyond MIT, I have earned the Natural Language Processing Specialization Certificate offered by deeplearning.ai.
