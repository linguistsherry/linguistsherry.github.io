About me
======
My name is Sherry Yong Chen, and I am an ABD (all but dissertation) PhD candidate at MIT Linguistics. I also serve as a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Fellow for MIT Graduate Student Council.


As a linguist……
======
I work primarily on semantics, pragmatics, and their interfaces, involving theoretical as well as experimental inquiries.
In my dissertation, I investigate the non-uniformity of presupposition projection in conditionals, drawing empirical data from adult language comprehension and child acquisition.


NLP and Computational Linguistics
======
I have worked on computational projects related to language model evaluation and ambiguity resolution.
In Summer 2021, I am completing an NLP/Language Engineer Internship at Principal Financial Group.
