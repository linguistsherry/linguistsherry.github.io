My name is Sherry Yong Chen, and I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at MIT (expected: June 2022). I specialize in psycholinguistics, with experience in natural language processing, data analytics, and quantitative research. 

As a language scientist
======
I am interested in exploring areas where linguistics, psychology, and computer science meet, with the goal to improve our understanding of how humans and machines acquire and comprehend language. I code in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am also experienced in statistical modeling and experimental design, and have led multiple, cross-institutional/continental collaborative projects. 

Iâ€™m a quick and avid leaner, always prepared to learn new things and develop my skillset. Beyond MIT, I have earned the Natural Language Processing Specialization Certificate offered by deeplearning.ai. 

My PhD work
======
I work primarily on semantics and pragmatics. My doctoral dissertation, which received a grant from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2140399">[National Science Foundation]</a>, investigated how adults and preschool-aged children understand presuppositional - information in complex linguistic environments. 

I have also worked on several research projects in computational linguistics; see <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/nlp/">[NLP Projects]</a> and <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/research/">[Research]</a> for details. 

Language technologies (industry)
======
In Summer 2021, I interned as an NLP/Linguistics Engineer on the Data Science Team at Principal Financial Group. 

In Summer 2022, I will begin working as Knowledge Engineer at Alexa AI - Information, based in Santa Barbara.
