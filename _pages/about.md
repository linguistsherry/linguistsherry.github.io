My name is Sherry Yong Chen, and I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at MIT (expected: June 2022). I specialize in psycholinguistics, with experience in natural language processing, data analytics, and quantitative research. 

As a language scientist
======
I am interested in exploring areas where linguistics, psychology, and computer science meet, with the goal to improve our understanding of how humans and machines acquire and comprehend language.

Iâ€™m a quick and avid leaner, always prepared to learn new things and develop my skillset. Beyond MIT, I have earned the Natural Language Processing Specialization Certificate offered by deeplearning.ai. 

My PhD work
======
I work primarily on how meaning is processed and acquired (semantics and pragmatics). In my doctoral dissertation, I investigated how presuppositions -- information taken for granted -- are understood in complex linguistic environments, drawing on novel empirical data from online experimentation with both adults and preschool-aged children. 

I have also worked on several research projects in computational linguistics, including language model evaluation and ambiguity resolution (see <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/nlp/">[NLP Projects]</a> and <a href="https://linguistsherry.github.io/research/">[Research]</a> for details). 
I code in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am also experienced in statistical modeling and experimental design, and have led multiple, cross-institutional/continental collaborative projects. 

Language technologies (industry)
======
In Summer 2021, I interned as an NLP/Linguistics Engineer on the Data Science Team at Principal Financial Group. 

In Summer 2022, I will begin working as Knowledge Engineer at Alexa AI - Information, based in Santa Barbara.
